WEPopover is an customizable popover controller which mimics and extends `UIPopoverController`'s APIs.


Installation
--------------------

The library's source code can be found in the WEPopover folder of the root directory. It also can images for default
look & feel of the popup.

Alternatively, you can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) and add the following line to your project's Podfile.

```
...
pod 'WEPopover', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/Labgoo/CocoaPodsSpecs/master/WEPopover/0.1.0/WEPopover.podspec'
...
```



Dependencies & Compatibility
--------------------

This library has been significantly improved from its original to use ARC and ObjC's features which are only recently available on iOS 5.0+. Hence, **iOS 5.0** is the minimum requirement.

You also need to add **QuartzCore** framework to your project. If you use CocoaPods, the dependency is automatically
handled for you! :-)


Features
--------------------

Please refer to Apple `UIPopoverController` [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIPopoverController_class/Reference/Reference.html) 
for the standard APIs to create and display a popover.

Additional features include:
- **Support for custom background views**: specify the `WEPopoverContainerViewProperties` for the view to use as 
background. The properties specify the images to use for the stretchable background and the arrows (four directions). 
It also specifies the margins and the cap sizes for resizing the background. A default image with corresponding 
arrows are supplied with the library.
- **Support for custom appearing and disappering animations**: use `- presentPopoverFromRect:inView:permittedArrowDirections:appearingAnimations:disappearingAnimations:`. 
The disappearing animations is animated by the popover controller when it dismisses the popover. However,
you can cancel this supplied disappearing animation by programmatically calling `- dismissPopoverAnimated:` with
a `NO` parameter.
- **Support for limiting the area to display the popover**: implement the protocol `WEPopoverParentView` for the view 
you supply to the presentPopover method and implement the `- displayAreaForPopover`.
